Test simple compile-time only program, no file output
Visualise AST somehow

Exception channeling for platforms like JVM (without burdening the runtime with real exceptions)
User-level intrinsics, eg. is it code or a global variable, assembly code representation, compile-time alternative in case the compiler runs it, name etc.
Compile-time allocator, easy as possible to use
